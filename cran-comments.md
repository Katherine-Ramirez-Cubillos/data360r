## Resubmission as of Sept. 2, 2018
This is a resubmission. In this version, the following edits were included to resolve feedback from CRAN (c/o Kurt Hornik):

### 1. For DESCRIPTION file
These have 'Author' fields in DESCRIPTION which contain calls to
person(), and hence should really be 'Authors@R' fields instead (from
which Author and Maintainer fields can be generated).  Can you pls fix
accordingly?

Offending Author fields shown below.


* FIX/ACTION DONE: Revised "Authors" field in Description to:

Authors@R: c(
    person("Ma. Regina Paz S.", "Onglao", email = "monglao@ifc.org", role = c("cre", "aut")),
    person("Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice",
    "World Bank Group", email = "tcdata360@worldbank.org", role = "cph"))

Also deleted the separate "Maintainer" field.

## Test environments
* local Windows install, 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0 (2017-01-27)
* win-builder (R-devel (unstable) (2018-08-28 r75203))

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

Status: 1 NOTE
NOTE
Maintainer: 'Ma. Regina Paz S. Onglao <monglao@ifc.org>'

* No problem since this is automatically generated by the Authors@R field. The slight change is in the inclusion of my middle initial ("S.") compared to the old version (without "S.").
